With this app you can group devices with the same capabilities as one device.

1) After installing, to add a new Group, click  + (add) upon the devices tab select "Group".
2) Now select the group device's class. (e.g. Light).
3) You will now see all the capabilities supported by this class. Now chose the ones you need. (e.g. Turned on" and "Dim level", "Temperature" ).
4) On this page you will find all devices that have the capabilties you selected, simply select the devices you want to group.
5) On this final page you change change the icon of the device if you would like, or select next to use the default.
6) Now you have one device to control all the grouped devices.

### Group Settings

There are two sets of settings associated with device groups, first the settings are available from the group, which offers overview information only.
The second more important method is currently unavailable due to a bug in the Homey v2 core.

### Contributions
