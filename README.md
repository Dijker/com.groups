With this app you can group devices with the same capabilities as one device.

1) After installing, to add a new Device Group, select "Device Groups" from the add new device modal popup.

2) Now select the group device's class. (e.g. Light).
On the next page you will see all the capabilities supported by this class.
 
3) Now chose the ones you need. (e.g. onoff and dim, temperature sensor).

4) Now on the last page you will find all devices that match these capabilities, select the devices you want to group and finish the pairing process.

5) Now you have one device to control all the grouped devices.

There are two sets of settings associated with device groups, first the settings available from the device group card. Which offers overview information 
 only.

More importantly there is the application settings, which can be accessed by clicking on your Homeys settings then the "Device Groups" link. 
It is from here, 

- You can change which devices are in a group. eg. *Add or remove a new light to a group*
- Set the feedback information for a specific group eg. *The On off button should only be on if all lights are on.*
- How grouped information is calculated for a specific capability on a specific group. - *Grouped temperature sensors upstairs should display the average of the entire group.*
